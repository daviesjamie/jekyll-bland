# jekyll-bland

*bland* is yet another "minimal" theme for Jekyll: it is very plain-looking by design, with no frills, embellishment or fancy fandangles to be found.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-bland"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-bland
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-bland

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

To test your theme, run `bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/bland`. This starts a Jekyll server using the theme and the contents of the `example/` directory. As you make modifications to the theme and the example site, the preview will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.
